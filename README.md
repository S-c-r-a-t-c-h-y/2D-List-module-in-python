# 2D-List-module-in-python

This is my first repository on github. 
I'm a beginner python programmer.

In this project, I wanted to facilitate the use of 2-dimensional lists with python.
I was inspired by the methods of the list class of python to create those of the List2D class.

Since I'm a begginner and I have a lot of things to learn, and the code can be easily improved or compacted.
I'd like to have feedback on this project as well as ideas to improve it or things to add.

(I'm not english so sorry for my bad english)
